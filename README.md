# AWS Notes, Experiments & Lessons Learned ☁️📒

Welcome!

This repository is basically where I **dump everything I’m learning about AWS** as I go. Think of it as my personal AWS notebook — the good, the bad, and the “why did I do that?” moments 😄

## 🧠 What This Repo Is About

You’ll find:

* AWS concepts I’m learning
* **Best practices** I’ve picked up
* **Mistakes I’ve made** (and how I fixed them)
* Notes from hands-on labs, real setups, and experiments
* Random tips I don’t want to forget later

This is not meant to be perfect — it’s meant to be **real**.

## 📁 How Things Are Organized

Everything is grouped by **AWS service or configuration**.
Each folder might include:

* Notes and explanations
* Example configs
* What went wrong
* What worked
* Things to avoid next time

Example:

```
/iam
/ec2
/vpc
/s3
/security
```

## 🔄 Always a Work in Progress

* This repo will **keep changing** as I learn more
* Files and the README will be updated over time
* Some early notes might be messy — that’s part of the journey

## 🤝 Feel Free to Contribute

If you:

* Notice a mistake
* Have a better approach
* Want to add tips or examples

Feel free to open a **PR or issue**. Everyone’s learning, so contributions are more than welcome 🙌

## ⚠️ Quick Note

* These are **my personal notes and experiences**
* Not everything here is production-ready
* Always double-check with official AWS docs before using anything in production
